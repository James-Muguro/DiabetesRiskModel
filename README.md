# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create an accurate predictive model for diagnosing diabetes using various machine learning algorithms. By leveraging health metrics such as glucose levels, blood pressure, and body mass index, the model aims to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic, ultimately aiding healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and intervention.

## Techniques Used

This project employs several key techniques throughout the data analysis and modeling process:

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Identification and handling of missing values.
  - Removal of outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to ensure the quality and reliability of the dataset.

- **Data Visualization**:
  - Utilization of visual tools to explore data distributions, trends, and relationships among features, facilitating a better understanding of the dataset.
  - Techniques include histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps.

- **Machine Learning Modeling**:
  - Implementation of multiple algorithms to identify the most effective model for predicting diabetes.
  - Training and testing of models using a clear train-test split to evaluate performance accurately.

## Algorithms Used

This project explores various machine learning algorithms, each with its strengths in handling different data patterns:

1. **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method for predicting binary classes, effective for linear decision boundaries.
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A robust algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate different classes, particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces.
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric method that classifies based on the majority class among the nearest neighbors in the feature space.
4. **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and control overfitting.
5. **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, effective for large datasets with strong independence assumptions among features.
6. **Gradient Boosting**: An ensemble technique that builds models in a stage-wise fashion, optimizing for accuracy and performance through weak learners.

## Model Evaluation Methods

To assess the effectiveness of the developed models, several evaluation methods are employed:

1. **Accuracy Score**: Measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model over the total predictions.
2. **ROC AUC Curve**: Evaluates the model's ability to distinguish between diabetic and non-diabetic classes across different thresholds, providing insights into sensitivity and specificity.
3. **Cross-Validation**: Involves partitioning the dataset into subsets to validate the model's performance and reduce the likelihood of overfitting.
4. **Confusion Matrix**: A comprehensive breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, allowing for a detailed analysis of model performance.
